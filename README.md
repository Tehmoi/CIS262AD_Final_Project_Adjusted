# CIS262AD_Final_Project
WHEN DOWNLOADING PROJECT : In the adapter files located under School.DAL, there will be a private string = "connectionString" with an output. 
REPLACE THAT CONNECTION STRING with the directory path of the "School.db" file. The database won't work unless the connectionString leads to the file.
School.DB is the database itself after downloading, you can manipulate the data using the links in the Student,Teacher, and Exam pages.
